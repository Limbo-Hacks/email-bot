# Mail bot

A bot to send reminders and notifications to hackers about announcements.

# Folder structure

Source code are inside src directory.

`announcements` -> `Sending mails for announcing or updates`.

`reminders` -> `Reminding about how much time left for workshops and submitting time.`

No external modules are required for now cuz we are using inbuilt mails.
